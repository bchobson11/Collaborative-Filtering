    "Mean-Squared-Error seems to converge to a common value as k increases. I believe this happens for 2 reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. As k increases the neighbors that are chosen for a particular item will have lesser weight therefore not affecting the prediction as much as the neighbors that are closer. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is a total amount of possible neighbors (n) for any particular movie. If k is bigger than the total amount of neighbors for this one movie, then this movie will be treated as only having n neighbors instead of k neighbors. For example if all movies have total neighbors less than 10, then for any value of k > 10. The algorithm will only pick the total amount of neighbors so the prediction will be very similar for values of k >= 10\n",
    "\n",
    "When test case has no neighbors then we can not choose any weights for prediction so there are two methods for getting around this\n",
    "+ Average Case - setting the prediction to the movie's average rating\n",
    "+ Ignored Case - ignoring the whole test case and not giving a prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the Average case vs the Ignored Case, the error for average case is lower because we are basically just setting the prediction to the average of what that movie rating is. Since the average rating can be seen as the expected and most seen value, then it is a safe prediction when we have nothing else to predict from. "
